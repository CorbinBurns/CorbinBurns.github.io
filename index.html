      on the main menue. Once in singleplayer mode click "Create New World". Then give the world a name and fill out the options. When you first start out you need
    know that the basic controls. 'w' 'a' 's' and 'd' make you move forward, left, down, and right. Then you can use the mouse to look around.
    The right mouse button is to place blocks while the left mouse button breaks blocks. 'e' is used to access your inventory where you can craft items
    and shift is used to crouch.</h4>

  <h2> Step 2 </h2>
  <h3> What To Do On Your First Night </h3>
  <h4> The best thing to do before your first night is get a lot of wood. Once you have around half a stack of wood (32) then you are ready to
  get tucked away for the night. To find a base for the night you will want to find a cave, in this cave you will be able to mine and do
  all the boring hard work during the night. You can also find valuable loot in caves if you look hard enough. But be careful even though
  you're unerground mobs can still spawn. </h4>

    <h2> Step 3 </h3>
    <h3> How To Get Gear, And Whats The Best? </h3>
    <h4> To make gear you will first need a crafting table which requires wood, and you will also need iron. Luckily you should have all of this
    from the night before since you were in the mine all night. The next step is to smelt the iron in a furnace. Then once you have enough iron
    start crafting the armor. Start off by making an iron breatplate and a sword. Then leggings, boots, and then finally a helmet ifyou have enought 
    iron. Iron is the second best armor and the easiest ore to find. The next level will be diamonds. </h4>
