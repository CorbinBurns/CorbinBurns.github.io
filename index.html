    know that the basic controls. 'w' 'a' 's' and 'd' make you move forward, left, down, and right. Then you can use the mouse to look around.

  <h2> Step 2 </h2>
  <h3> What To Do On Your First Night </h3>
  <h4> The best thing to do before your first night is get a lot of wood. Once you have around half a stack of wood (32) then you are ready to
  get tucked away for the night. To find a base for the night you will want to find a cave, in this cave you will be able to mine and do
  all the boring hard work during the night. You can also find valuable loot in caves if you look hard enough. But be careful even though
  you're unerground mobs can still spawn. </h4>
